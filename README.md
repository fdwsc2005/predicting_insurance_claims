Insurance Claim Prediction Analysis

Executive Summary

This report presents an analysis of an insurance dataset aimed at predicting claim probabilities. The dataset encompasses various features related to insurance policies and vehicles, including demographic information, policy tenure, vehicle characteristics, and claim history.

Key Findings

Data Exploration:
The dataset consists of both numerical and categorical features, with missing values present in some columns.
Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable, providing valuable context for predictive modeling.
Feature Engineering:
Preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dropping irrelevant columns.
Imbalanced classes were addressed using the ADASYN oversampling technique to improve model performance.
Model Development:
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost classifiers.
Model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess each model's predictive capability.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV was employed to optimize the XGBoost classifier, resulting in improved performance.
Model Evaluation:
Cross-validation was performed to assess the model's stability and generalization across different subsets of the data.
The ROC AUC score was used to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes, with a score of 1.00 indicating exceptional performance.
Model Deployment:
The trained XGBoost model with optimized hyperparameters was saved to disk for future use.
Predictions were made on the test data using the trained model, and performance metrics were calculated to evaluate model effectiveness.
